# Pokedex - Web

This is a Pokedex Project made by Darshik Ladhe as a GDG club problem statement for IIT INDORE

Used the official PokeApi u can find in src/api/

### Key Feature

1. Features a search bar to directly search the name of the Pokemon and then displays the details cleanly.
2. Has a Gallery mode on the Navbar (Gallery mode icon) which would allow you to search and see the pokemons as a Gallery on site.
3. You can also Search for the pokemon id or the Pokedex id (official pokemon
   id) which would give you the same result as if it was for the pokemon name.

Tech Stacks/Dependencies : react, tailwindcss, react-icons, react-dom
