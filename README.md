# Pokedex - Web

This is a Pokedex Project made by Darshik Ladhe as a GDG club problem statement for IIT INDORE

It is a Frontend only Application and Only uses an Api Call

Used the official PokeApi u can find in src/api/

### Key Features

1. Features a search bar to directly search the name of the Pokemon and then displays the details cleanly.
2. Has a Gallery mode on the Navbar (Gallery mode icon) which would allow you to search and see the pokemons as a Gallery on site.
3. You can also Search for the pokemon id or the Pokedex id (official pokemon
   id) which would give you the same result as if it was for the pokemon name.
4. You can also see the evolution chain for the Pokemon but only when you searched for only 1 pokemon and not multiple gallery mode

#### For Pokemons Like EEVEE (who have multiple evolutions possible), The site will display only one of them and not all, I will add branchings to the chaining later if recommended

Tech Stacks: React JS, tailwindcss
